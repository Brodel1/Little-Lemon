## **Little Lemon website (fully responsive)**
This project is part of the **[Meta Front-End Developer Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)** final project assessment and focuses solely on **reservation functionality**. The technologies I have used in this project are listed below

    useContext 	- state management
    Chakra-UI 	- main UI
    Antd		- datepicker

If anyone is struggling to comprehend the instructions in the lesson like me, you can use this project as an example.

> **The more you code, the more you learn.**
